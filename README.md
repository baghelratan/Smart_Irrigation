Introduction
Smart irrigation systems help conserve water and improve crop yields by automating irrigation based on soil and environmental conditions. This project implements a machine learning model that predicts whether irrigation is required based on real-time sensor inputs.

Features
Real-time decision-making using sensor input (temperature, humidity, soil moisture, etc.)
Machine learning-based prediction for efficient irrigation
User-friendly web interface built with Streamlit
Scalable and easily deployable system
Reduces water waste and improves farming efficiency
Problem Statement
Traditional irrigation methods waste significant amounts of water, often leading to over- or under-watering of crops. Manual monitoring is time-consuming and inefficient. There‚Äôs a need for a smart, automated system that can make decisions based on environmental conditions.

Solution
This system takes real-time sensor data as input and uses a trained machine learning model to predict whether irrigation is required. It outputs a simple decision‚ÄîTurn ON or Turn OFF the sprinkler‚Äîbased on data like temperature, humidity, and soil moisture levels.

Installation
git clone https://github.com/baghelratan/Smart_Irrigation.git
cd Smart_Irrigation
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the Streamlit app using the following command:

streamlit run Irrigation_System.ipynb
Make sure you have a file named Farm_Irrigation_System.pkl in the same directory (trained ML model).

Sample Predictions
Temperature	Humidity	Soil Moisture	Prediction
34¬∞C	42%	0.15	Turn ON
25¬∞C	70%	0.40	Turn OFF
‚öôImprovisations Done
Added real-time sensor simulation for local testing
Improved model accuracy with feature scaling and hyperparameter tuning
Developed a responsive UI using Streamlit
Packaged the model using joblib for fast loading
Conclusion
This Smart Irrigation System ensures sustainable water use by automating the irrigation process using environmental data and predictive analytics. It is ideal for precision agriculture, helping farmers save water and optimize crop yield.

Would you like me to include:

- Screenshots from your UI?
- Sample `.csv` data used for model training?
- An API version or extension for IoT device deployment?

Let me know if you want this pushed directly to your repo (I can guide you on how), or if you're using this for a presentation/report as well.
